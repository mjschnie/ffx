Force Field X 
=============

Force Field X is an atomic resolution molecular modeling application that targets open research questions in the areas of:
* predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability and solubility of organic polymer crystals,
* predicting the effect of missense mutations on protein structure, thermodynamics and molecular phenotype
* computational design of biomolecules in both soluble and crystalline environments

Please see the Force Field X [website](http://ffx.biochem.uiowa.edu) for more details.
